# Hey.
I'm Scott Beru (n√© Reu). My pronouns are he/him or they/them (either is fine, I have no preference).

I'm a Site Reliability Engineer working at Google in Munich, Germany. In the past, I've also worked at Cisco, Meraki, AMP Robotics, and ActBlue.

This blog is just a little self-hosted project designed to give me a place to show off some of the cool stuff I work on.
