This year, I submitted a talk to Kubecon about Helm, Terraform, and Kubernetes, and…I was rejected!

But the amazing thing about the tech community is that there are some really generous people at Kinvolk and Microsoft who put together a “B-sides” conference for Kubecon CFP submitters who weren’t accepted. It was a rousing success, and although I was on short notice to produce this talk, I was also pretty pleased with how it came out.

The slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ClEUgZvzWYiBomKGTP5aCiMMRIosu7I3nZ02-qnmYjI/edit?usp=sharing), in case you’re interested in following any of the links I mention (or seeing the Director’s Cut, including my very funny self-intro slide which I had to cut for time to squeeze the full demo in).

This was a lot of fun to make; I I hope it proves informative for you!
