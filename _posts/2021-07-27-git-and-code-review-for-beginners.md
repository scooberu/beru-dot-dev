Lately, I’ve been volunteering with [The Collab Lab](https://the-collab-lab.codes/), a nonprofit org that works to give early-in-career (and predominantly not cis/white/male) folks exposure to the non-coding aspects of software engineering. It focuses on Code Reviews, Git, Retrospectives, and resume-building. It’s really great, and I’m proud to work with them.

In the spirit of sharing some material that both a) might be useful to other EIC folks and b) shows me in my capacity as a presenter of technical material, I thought I would post some videos of me presenting some learning module content for The Collab Lab.
